		  satisfying about keeping information in digital form. It
		  does not take up much space. It can be replicated for
		  resilient preservation. It can be searched mechanically. It
		  can be used to combine with other material using digital
		  power tools. But this blissful outlook may not comport with
		  the reality of digital information preservation and
		  interpretation.},

  Abstract	= {Software is increasingly crucial to scholarship, yet the
		  visibility and usefulness of software in the scientific
		  record are in question. Just as with data, the visibility
		  of software in publications is related to incentives to
		  share software in reusable ways, and so promote efficient
		  science. In this article, we examine software in
		  publications through content analysis of a random sample of
		  90 biology articles. We develop a coding scheme to identify
		  software “mentions” and classify them according to
		  their characteristics and ability to realize the functions
		  of citations. Overall, we find diverse and problematic
		  practices: Only between 31\% and 43\% of mentions involve
		  formal citations; informal mentions are very common, even
		  in high impact factor journals and across different kinds
		  of software. Software is frequently inaccessible
		  (15\%–29\% of packages in any form; between 90\% and 98\%
		  of specific versions; only between 24\%–40\% provide
		  source code). Cites to publications are particularly poor
		  at providing version information, whereas informal mentions
		  are particularly poor at providing crediting information.
		  We provide recommendations to improve the practice of
		  software citation, highlighting recent nascent efforts.
		  Software plays an increasingly great role in scientific
		  practice; it deserves a clear and useful place in scholarly
		  communication.},

  Abstract	= {Abstract In geodynamics as in other scientific areas,
		  computation has become a core component of research,
		  complementing field observation, laboratory analysis,
		  experiment, and theory. Computational tools for data
		  analysis, mapping, visualization, modeling, and simulation
		  are essential for all aspects of the scientific workflow.
		  Specialized scientific software is often developed by
		  geodynamicists for their own use, and this effort
		  represents a distinctive intellectual contribution. Drawing
		  on a geodynamics community that focuses on developing and
		  disseminating scientific software, we assess the current
		  practices of software development and attribution, as well
		  as attitudes about the need and best practices for software
		  citation. We analyzed publications by participants in the
		  Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics and conducted
		  mixed method surveys of the solid earth geophysics
		  community. From this we learned that coding skills are
		  typically learned informally. Participants considered good
		  code as trusted, reusable, readable, and not overly complex
		  and considered a good coder as one that participates in the
		  community in an open and reasonable manor contributing to
		  both long- and short-term community projects. Participants
		  strongly supported citing software reflected by the high
		  rate a software package was named in the literature and the
		  high rate of citations in the references. However, lacking
		  are clear instructions from developers on how to cite and
		  education of users on what to cite. In addition, citations
		  did not always lead to discoverability of the resource. A
		  unique identifier to the software package itself, community
		  education, and citation tools would contribute to better
		  attribution practices.},

  Abstract	= {In many disciplines, data are highly decentralized across
		  thousands of online databases (repositories, registries,
		  and knowledgebases). Wringing value from such databases
		  depends on the discipline of data science and on the humble
		  bricks and mortar that make integration possible;
		  identifiers are a core component of this integration
		  infrastructure. Drawing on our experience and on work by
		  other groups, we outline 10 lessons we have learned about
		  the identifier qualities and best practices that facilitate
		  large-scale data integration. Specifically, we propose
		  actions that identifier practitioners (database providers)
		  should take in the design, provision and reuse of
		  identifiers. We also outline the important considerations
		  for those referencing identifiers in various circumstances,
		  including by authors and data generators. While the
		  importance and relevance of each lesson will vary by
		  context, there is a need for increased awareness about how
		  to avoid and manage common identifier problems, especially
		  those related to persistence and
		  web-accessibility/resolvability. We focus strongly on
		  web-based identifiers in the life sciences; however, the
		  principles are broadly relevant to other disciplines.},

		  (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and package repositories (e.g.,
		  PyPI, Debian, NPM), and stored in a uniform representation
		  linking together source code files, directories, commits,
		  and full snapshots of version control systems (VCS)
		  repositories as observed by Software Heritage during
		  periodic crawls. This dataset is unique in terms of
		  accessibility and scale, and allows to explore a number of
		  research questions on the long tail of public software
		  development, instead of solely focusing on "most starred"
		  repositories as it often happens.},

		  Compression},
  Abstract	= {We consider the problem of mining the development
		  historyâ€”as captured by modern version control
		  systemsâ€”of ultra-large-scale software archives
		  (e.g., tens of millions software repositories
		  corresponding). We show that graph compression techniques
		  can be applied to the problem, dramatically reducing the
		  hardware resources needed to mine similarly-sized corpus.
		  As a concrete use case we compress the full Software
		  Heritage archive, consisting of 5 billion unique source
		  code files and 1 billion unique commits, harvested from
		  more than 80 million software projectsâ€”encompassing
		  a full mirror of GitHub. The resulting compressed graph
		  fits in less than 100 GB of RAM, corresponding to a

  Title		= {Referencing Source Code Artifacts: a Separate Concern in
		  Software Citation},
  Abstract	= {Among the entities involved in software citation, software
		  source code requires special attention, due to the role it
		  plays in ensuring scientific reproducibility. To reference
		  source code we need identifiers that are not only unique
		  and persistent, but also support integrity checking
		  intrinsically. Suitable iden- tifiers must guarantee that
		  denoted objects will always stay the same, without relying
		  on external third parties and administrative processes. We
		  analyze the role of identifiers for digital objects (IDOs),
		  whose properties are different from, and complementary to,
		  those of the various digital identifiers of objects (DIOs)
		  that are today popular building blocks of software and data
		  citation toolchains. We argue that both kinds of
		  identifiers are needed and detail the syntax, semantics,
		  and practical implementation of the persistent identifiers
		  (PIDs) adopted by the Software Heritage project to
		  reference billions of software source code artifacts such
		  as source code files, directories, and commits.},

  Abstract	= {Software is a fundamental pillar of modern scientific
		  research, across all fields and disciplines. However, there
		  is a lack of adequate means to cite and reference software
		  due to the complexity of the problem in terms of
		  authorship, roles, and credits. This complexity is further
		  increased when it is considered over the lifetime of a
		  software that can span up to several decades. Building upon
		  the internal experience of Inria, the French research
		  institute for digital sciences, we provide in this article
		  a contribution to the ongoing efforts in order to develop
		  proper guidelines and recommendations for software citation
		  and reference. Namely, we recommend: first, a richer
		  taxonomy for software contributions with a qualitative
		  scale; second, to put humans at the heart of the
		  evaluation; and third, to distinguish citation from
		  reference.},

abstract={The FAIR Guiding Principles, published in 2016, aim to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of digital research objects for both humans and machines. Until now the FAIR principles have been mostly applied to research data. The ideas behind these principles are, however, also directly relevant to research software. Hence there is a distinct need to explore how the FAIR principles can be applied to software. In this work, we aim to summarize the current status of the debate around FAIR and software, as basis for the development of community-agreed principles for FAIR research software in the future. We discuss what makes software different from data with regard to the application of the FAIR principles, and which desired characteristics of research software go beyond FAIR. Then we present an analysis of where the existing principles can directly be applied to software, where they need to be adapted or reinterpreted, and where the definition of additional principles is required. Here interoperability has proven to be the most challenging principle, calling for particular attention in future discussions. Finally, we outline next steps on the way towards definite FAIR principles for research software.},

It presented OCamlP3L, a parallel programming system written in the OCaml programming language. It turns out that we found the source code of the OCamlP3L system only in Software Heritage: since it was saved with all its development history, we could perform this reproduction experiment.}

  title = {Gender Differences in Public Code Contributions: a 50-year Perspective},
  abstract = {Gender imbalance in information technology in general, and Free/Open Source Software specifically, is a well-known problem in the field. Still, little is known yet about the large-scale extent and long-term trends that underpin the phenomenon. We contribute to fill this gap by conducting a longitudinal study of the population of contributors to publicly available software source code. We analyze 1.6 billion commits corresponding to the development history of 120 million projects, contributed by 33 million distinct authors over a period of 50 years. We classify author names by gender and study their evolution over time. We show that, while the amount of commits by female authors remains low overall, there is evidence of a stable long-term increase in their proportion over all contributions, providing hope of a more gender-balanced future for collaborative software development.},
