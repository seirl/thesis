		  files and one billion unique commits, coming from more than
		  80 million software projects. These software artifacts were
		  retrieved from major collaborative development platforms
		  (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and package repositories (e.g.,
		  PyPI, Debian, NPM), and stored in a uniform representation
		  linking together source code files, directories, commits,
		  and full snapshots of version control systems (VCS)
		  repositories as observed by Software Heritage during
		  periodic crawls. This dataset is unique in terms of
		  accessibility and scale, and allows to explore a number of
		  research questions on the long tail of public software
		  development, instead of solely focusing on "most starred"
		  repositories as it often happens.},

  Abstract	= {We consider the problem of mining the development
		  historyâ€”as captured by modern version control
		  systemsâ€”of ultra-large-scale software archives
		  (e.g., tens of millions software repositories
		  corresponding). We show that graph compression techniques
		  can be applied to the problem, dramatically reducing the
		  hardware resources needed to mine similarly-sized corpus.
		  As a concrete use case we compress the full Software
		  Heritage archive, consisting of 5 billion unique source
		  code files and 1 billion unique commits, harvested from
		  more than 80 million software projectsâ€”encompassing
		  a full mirror of GitHub. The resulting compressed graph
		  fits in less than 100 GB of RAM, corresponding to a
		  hardware cost of less than 300 U.S. dollars. We show that
		  the compressed in-memory representation of the full corpus
		  can be accessed with excellent performances, with edge
		  lookup times close to memory random access. As a sample
		  exploitation experiment we show that the compressed graph
		  can be used to conduct clone detection at this scale,
		  benefiting from main memory access speed.},

  Abstract	= {Among the entities involved in software citation, software
		  source code requires special attention, due to the role it
		  plays in ensuring scientific reproducibility. To reference
		  source code we need identifiers that are not only unique
		  and persistent, but also support integrity checking
		  intrinsically. Suitable iden- tifiers must guarantee that
		  denoted objects will always stay the same, without relying
		  on external third parties and administrative processes. We
		  analyze the role of identifiers for digital objects (IDOs),
		  whose properties are different from, and complementary to,
		  those of the various digital identifiers of objects (DIOs)
		  that are today popular building blocks of software and data
		  citation toolchains. We argue that both kinds of
		  identifiers are needed and detail the syntax, semantics,
		  and practical implementation of the persistent identifiers
		  (PIDs) adopted by the Software Heritage project to
		  reference billions of software source code artifacts such
		  as source code files, directories, and commits.},

  abstract = {Gender imbalance in information technology in general, and Free/Open Source Software specifically, is a well-known problem in the field. Still, little is known yet about the large-scale extent and long-term trends that underpin the phenomenon. We contribute to fill this gap by conducting a longitudinal study of the population of contributors to publicly available software source code. We analyze 1.6 billion commits corresponding to the development history of 120 million projects, contributed by 33 million distinct authors over a period of 50 years. We classify author names by gender and study their evolution over time. We show that, while the amount of commits by female authors remains low overall, there is evidence of a stable long-term increase in their proportion over all contributions, providing hope of a more gender-balanced future for collaborative software development.},

abstract={The open source community relies upon licensing in order to govern the distribution, modification, and reuse of existing code. These licenses evolve to better suit the requirements of the development communities and to cope with unaddressed or new legal issues. In this paper, we report the results of a large empirical study conducted over the change history of 16,221 open source Java projects mined from Git Hub. Our study investigates how licensing usage and adoption changes over a period of ten years. We consider both the distribution of license usage within projects of a rapidly growing forge and the extent that new versions of licenses are introduced in these projects.},

<dt>Abstract</dt><dd>
<p>We continue the line of research on graph compression
started with WebGraph, but we move our focus to the compression of
<em>social networks</em> in a proper sense (e.g., LiveJournal):
the approaches that have been used for a long time to compress web graphs
rely on a <em>specific</em> ordering of the nodes (lexicographical
URL ordering) whose extension to general social networks is not trivial. In this
paper, we propose a solution that mixes clusterings and orders, 
and devise a new algorithm, called <em>Layered Label Propagation</em>, that builds
on previous work on scalable clustering and can be used to reorder very large
graphs (billions of nodes). Our implementation uses <em>decomposition</em> to
perform aggressively on multi-core architecture, making it possible to reorder
graphs of more than 600 millions nodes in a few hours.
Experiments performed on a wide array of web graphs
and social networks show that combining the order produced by the proposed
algorithm with the WebGraph compression framework provides a major
increase in compression with respect to all currently known techniques, 
<em>both</em> on web graphs <em>and</em> on social networks.
These improvements make it possible to analyse in main memory significantly
larger graphs.</p></dd>

<p>Studying web graphs is often difficult due to their large size. Recently,
several proposals have been published about various techniques that allow to
store a web graph in memory in a limited space, exploiting the inner
redundancies of the web. The WebGraph framework is a suite of codes, algorithms
and tools that aims at making it easy to manipulate large web graphs. This
papers presents the compression techniques used in WebGraph, which are centred
around referentiation and intervalisation (which in turn are dual to each
other). WebGraph can compress the WebBase graph (118 Mnodes, 1 Glinks)
in as little as 3.08 bits per link, and its transposed version in as little
as 2.89 bits per link.</p></dd>

<dt>Abstract</dt><dd>
  <p>Recent advances in random linear systems on finite fields have paved the way
  for the construction of constant-time data structures representing static
  functions and minimal perfect hash functions using less space with respect to
  existing techniques. The main obstruction for any practical application of
  these results is the cubic-time Gaussian elimination required to solve these
  linear systems: despite they can be made very small, the computation is still
  too slow to be feasible.</p>

  <p>In this paper we describe in detail a number of heuristics and programming
  techniques to speed up the resolution of these systems by several orders of
  magnitude, making the overall construction competitive with the standard and
  widely used MWHC technique, which is based on hypergraph peeling. In
  particular, we introduce <em>broadword programming</em> techniques for fast
  equation manipulation and a <em>lazy Gaussian elimination</em> algorithm. We
  also describe a number of technical improvements to the data structure which
  further reduce space usage and improve lookup speed.</p>
  
  <p>Our implementation of these techniques yields a minimal perfect hash function
  data structure occupying 2.24 bits per element, compared to 2.68 for
  MWHC-based ones, and a static function data structure which reduces the
  multiplicative overhead from 1.23 to 1.03.</p>

    abstract = {Querying graph data is a fundamental problem that witnesses an
                increasing interest especially for massive graph databases
                which come as a promising alternative to relational databases
                for big data modeling. In this paper, we study the problem of
                subgraph isomorphism search which consists to enumerate the
                embedding of a query graph in a data graph. The most known
                solutions of this NP-complete problem are backtracking-based
                and result in a high computational cost when we deal with
                massive graph databases. We address this problem and its
                challenges via graph compression with modular decomposition. In
                our approach, subgraph isomorphism search is performed on
                compressed graphs without decompressing them yielding
                substantial reduction of the search space and consequently a
                significant saving in processing time as well as in storage
                space for the graphs. We evaluated our algorithms on nine
                real-word datasets. The experimental results show that our
                approach is efficient and scalable.}
